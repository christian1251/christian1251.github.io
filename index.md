### CPSC 120

* [Lab 5](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-05-kush-christian)

    One of my favorite labs was Lab 5. Both the Blackjack and Sandwich Madlib were very interesting and fun since it was the first time that we had utilized command line arguments, rather than prompting the user for input. I believe that it was a great introduction to command line arguments because it only used three inputs. We also used logical operators for if statements in Part 2 which were fun to work with.

    Lab 6, Part 2 was also a favorite because of the introduction of vectors. We converted the command line arguments into a vector of integers, which we then found the average of. This lab allowed me to grasp the basic concepts of vectors, which were proved to be very important in the next labs. 

* [Lab 10](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-10-jeremy-and-christian)

    Lab 10, Part 2 was difficult yet interesting. In this lab, we had to use 2-dimensional vectors and print out information from the vector given a command line input. This lab taught my partner and I how to use 2-D vectors and what functions are required to filter out a specific target value from the vector.
